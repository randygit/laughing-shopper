          | TropicalMeds is not a pharmacy. Our business is customer service. TropicalMeds serves its customers and partner pharmacies by providing a common platform from which buyers and sellers meet.  
        p.conditions
          | We choose our partner pharmacies carefully so as to provide members a reliable and cost effective way to purchase their medicines online. Our members benefit from our pre-screening of our partner pharmacies which in turn fill their orders.
        p.conditions
          | The pharmacies benefit by making their products available on the world-wide-web through our website without the cost of creating and maintaining their own web storefronts.  For this service, we earn a commission for each fulfilled order.
